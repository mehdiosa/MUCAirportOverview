## Description
The Munich Airport Overview app is a simple project displaying flight information of the Munich Airport, sorted by arriving and departing flights, as well as by terminal.

It was designed for Taxi Drivers who need to know about the incoming flights before arriving at the airport, in order to decide which terminal they want to wait for potential passengers.

Additionally the app can be used for anyone looking for an incoming or departing flight, for example, when picking someone up from the airport or to check your own flight, respectively.

## Demo
A live app demo is available under [this link](https://appetize.io/embed/tlyu7k4czrhkg2gcurz3dqkeu4). The demo is available on [appetize.io](https://appetize.io), allowing the app to run in any modern browser and on multiple (virtual) devices.

## Note:
This application was intended as a proof of concept. The data is acquired directly from the website of the Munich airport, which is not optimal.

I am planning on recreating the app using an API which can not only read the data from the Munich Airport, but any Airport in the world. Please find the (currently work in progress) repository under [this link](https://github.com/mehdiosa/AirportData)
